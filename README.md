# Manage My Residents
A Personal Care Home Manager

---
## Description
MMR is a webapp to help manage day to day information about Residents in a personal care home.
The goal is to be able to have information readily available about Residents such as general information, meals, diatery needs, appointments, etc.

## What it does right now
Currently MMR lets you sign-up*, sign-in, view residents, add residents, edit residents, remove residents, generate AI Images based on description provided when adding a resident. You can also upload profile pictures for the User and change homes to change different Residents.

*The signup right now is rate limited by Supabase. Will attempt to setup a SMTP server to fix this issue.

## Inspiration
I work in a personal care home and it's tough to know and keep track of a lot of residents and a lot of information is kept on paper. The idea is to have an all in one resource that's easy to use and targeted towards the workers for making life a little easier.
